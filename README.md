Make PAMM url links work on Mac OSX !
=================================

Drop the startpamm.app in the /Applications folder, it will register and handle the pamm:// protocol.

This has only been tested on OSX 10.9 (Mavericks), but Uberent recommends this version for running PA.

It assumes PAMM has been installed into the UberLauncher data tree, `~/Library/Application Support/Uber Entertainment/Planetary Annihilation/pamm/PAMM.app`.
If your PA.app is somewhere else, edit it's path in `startpamm.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/main.scpt`
