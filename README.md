=================================

Make replay links on PA-Stats work on Mac OSX

Drop the startpa.app in the /Applications folder, it will register and handle the startpa:// protocol.

This has only been tested on OSX 10.9 (Mavericks), but Uberent recommends this version for running PA.

It assumes PA has been installed via Steam, in the standard Steam folder.
If your PA.app is somewhere else, edit it's path in startpa.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/main.scpt
